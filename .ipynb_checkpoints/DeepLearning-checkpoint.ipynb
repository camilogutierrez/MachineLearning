    "where g could be a nonlinear function that may not be the sigmoid function. So for example, the sigmoid function goes within zero and one, and activation function that almost always works better than the sigmoid function is the tangent function or the hyperbolic tangent function. So this is z, this is a, this is a equals tanh(z), and this goes between plus 1 and minus 1. The formula for the tanh function is e to the z minus e to the negative z over their sum. And is actually mathematically, a shifted version of the sigmoid function. So, as a sigmoid function just like that, but shifted so that it now crosses a zero zero point and v scale, so it goes 15 minus 1 and plus 1. And it turns out for hidden units, if you let the function g of z be equal to tanh(z), this almost always works better than the sigmoid function because the values between plus 1 and minus 1, the mean of the activations that come out of your head, and they are closer to having a 0 mean. And so just as sometimes when you train a learning algorithm, you might center the data and have your data have 0 mean using a tanh instead of a sigmoid function. It kind of has the effect of centering your data so that the mean of your data is closer to 0 rather than, maybe 0.5. And this\n",
